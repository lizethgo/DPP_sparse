This repository contains code to partially support the publication: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9790881. Multiple Neural Networks arechitectures were customize to simultaneously prune and quantize models. The key contribution was to use a softmax-based algorithm to prune layers such as they fit hardware needs
